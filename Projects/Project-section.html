        <h1>Fun Fact</h1>
        <p>I've been playing video games since I was seven years old. The first game I ever played was Circus, a retro game, and it sparked my love for technology. Since then, I've been fascinated by the world of gaming and how technology continues to evolve. It's incredible to see how games have progressed from simple graphics to immersive virtual realities. This passion for gaming has fueled my curiosity and sparked a lifelong interest in exploring new technologies.</p>
